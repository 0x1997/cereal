Getting Help With cereal
========

If you have a question about using cereal that isn't answered either here or in the
[doxygen]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/doxygen/index.html), the first thing you should do is see if giving your problem a bit
more thought can solve it.  If not, the second thing you should do is to search and see if someone has
had a similar problem before.

If you think you have an issue that is new and exciting, there are a number of places to go for help:

1. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cereal) for that precious public repuation
2. The online [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cerealcpp), which you can also <a href="mailto:cerealcpp@googlegroups.com">email directly</a>
3. The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues?state=open), if your issue is more technical and related
   to the library code

### Submitting bug reports

If you think you've found a bug in cereal, you should open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues?state=open).

If you can, give us a minimal test case to reproduce your issue.
