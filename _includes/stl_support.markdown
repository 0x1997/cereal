Standard Library Support
========================

cereal supports most of the containers found in the C++ standard library out of the box.

---

To use a type found in the standard library, just include the proper header from `#include <cereal/types/xxxx.hpp>`

See the [doxygen docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/doxygen/group__STLSupport.html) for a complete list of supported types.
